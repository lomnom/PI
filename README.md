# PI, the most ineffecient and beautiful pi calculator!
## Usage:

`python3 PI.py <delay>`, where delay is the minimum time that calculating every digit must take  
When stopped with `ctrl-c`, it will make a file called `PI.txt` with all the progress it has made in calculating pi.  
**The next time it runs, it will start from the start again!**
